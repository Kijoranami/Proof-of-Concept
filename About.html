    <!-- ABOUT ME -->

    <div class="aboutme">Hello! Welcome to my gallery, a small website I made that showcases the countless virtual photographs I've taken from three of my favorite games. I am a virtual photographer, a hobby I've been doing since I was pretty young.. My experience as a creative computing student worked well together as a virtual photographer as I create my own shots and scene with the help of what I've learned from school, and it helped me create this website too! I probably wouldn't have pursued this hobby if it weren't for my love of photography and the beauty of the real and digital world. And I'd like to introduce you to this hobby of mine and hope you enjoy!</div>

    <div class="inspirationtitle">INSPIRATION</div>
    <div class="inspiration">The inspiration that brought me to continue on with this hobby is real photographers, fantasy worlds, and escapism, I have a love for eye candy, in where you look at something gorgeous, beautiful, enamoring, and your eyes feast on this sight, just the feeling of it makes me feel like a glutton. So games created on different settings and theme different from ours, I was instantly hyped for all the eye candy I could find and consume. There is never going to be a moment where I would get tired of the taste of photography.</div>

    <div class="toolstitle">TOOLS USED</div>
    <div class="tools">
        The tools I've used to create are as follows: <br />GAMES - Skyrim SE, Fallout 4, Cyberpunk 2077 <br />VISUALS - Reshade 4, ENB <br />CAMERA - Otis_Inf Camera Tools
